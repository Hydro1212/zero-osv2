# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Re-apply and verify all existing source files so the deployed application reflects the current codebase state with all previously implemented features.

**Planned changes:**
- Ensure the neon/cyberpunk OS-style desktop UI renders correctly with Taskbar, AppIcons, Windows, SettingsPanel, and Wallpaper components
- Ensure the expanded settings panel (appearance, typography, effects, clock, taskbar, wallpaper sections) is accessible and functional
- Ensure the bottom taskbar displays the live clock, open window buttons, add-app button, and settings button
- Ensure particle effects render on the desktop canvas when enabled
- Ensure app icons render with favicon, glow effects, and correct sizing from settings
- Ensure backend endpoints for adding/getting apps and saving/getting settings respond correctly

**User-visible outcome:** The live app displays the full neon/cyberpunk desktop UI with all previously implemented features working as intended, with no visual regressions.
