  "summary": "The diff shows a comprehensive re-application of all major frontend and backend source files matching the described Version 3 state. The backend includes all Settings types and CRUD endpoints; frontend components cover Desktop, Taskbar, AppIcon, Window, SettingsPanel, ParticleEffect, Wallpaper, AddAppDialog, PinDialog, and supporting hooks/styles. All REQ-1 acceptance criteria appear addressed: neon/cyberpunk UI, expanded settings panel with 7 sections, bottom taskbar with clock/buttons, particle effects canvas, favicon-based app icons with glow, and backend endpoints for apps/settings. No significant missing requirements or hallucinated features were detected.",
